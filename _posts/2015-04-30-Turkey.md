Easter Tour means one thing: sport climbing in somewhere hot. This year the destination was Olympos in Turkey. For several of the members it was the first time climbing outside but they were taken care of and soon learnt the ropes. With a wide range of climbing routes aimed at all abilities everyone found something to climb and enjoy. Due to being such a lovely area there were also many walks to go on, ruins to explore and even swimming. The food was delicious, the beer was flowing and the climbing hard but everyone had an amazing time. All of the equipment was provided by the Outdoor Club for anyone worried they’ll have to shell loads out on equipment. For anyone interested in sport climbing with the Outdoor Club (and you should be), 2016’s Easter tour will be to Kalymnos in Greece for even more sport climbing fun!!
