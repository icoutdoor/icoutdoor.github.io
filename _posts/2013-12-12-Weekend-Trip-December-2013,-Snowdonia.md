Final trip of term in Snowdon national park. Unfortunately, the weather wasn’t dry enough to climb but we found some other fun things to do instead. Saturday we headed out to Pen Y Pass where we climbed Snowdon from three different routes. Scrambling Crib Goch had to be the most fun (see picture), although we did encounter patches of snow on the other ascents which made the traverse very trecherous…

After an exhilirating day on the mountain we came back to mulled wine and the traditional christmas chilli, eaten by the fire in the very fine Pen Y Clogwyn cottage.

Sunday was another day full of adventures: including looking for waterfalls in Betws y Coed, more scaling mountains (this time the Glyders) and some mountain biking on the fantastic Marin trail (note, always bring a pump).
