What a year it's been for the Outdoor Club! From scenic sunny climbs near Malaga to wet and windy hikes in Wales, it has been a busy year for us and out 120 members.

# First Term: Day trips, Snowdonia and the Brecons

We kicked off the year with two day trips - one hike in the beautiful Chess Valley and a day of climbing at Harrison's Rocks, both easily accessible by train from London. By the third weekend, we were ready for something more: we got into several cars and made our way up to Snowdonia for a mixed activity weekend where we spent Saturday climbing at the amazing Dinorwig slate quarry and Sunday hiking up mount Snowdon. Of course, we had perfect, cloudless views - until we got to the top, when we were blanketed in cloud.

After another day hike to the south coast, our second weekend trip was to The Roaches in the Brecon Beacons, where we stayed in the Don Whillans hut, where Outdoor Club is practically a regular at this point! We spent two days hiking and climbing in the area before making our way back to London.
