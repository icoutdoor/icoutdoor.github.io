3 lessons were to be learnt this weekend.

Lesson #1: **Welsh winter never lasts:** fortunately we managed to get in one good winter day before the rain came and washed it all away. Starting at 8am, Ryan took a team on a Winter walk, tackling steep ground with walking axes and winter boots (some had never done this before). Gemma and team climbed The Ramp, a spectacular grade III climb, short but very sweet. Although the Devil’s kitchen looked spectacular with the Devil’s Appendix glimmering from above, the Ramp was the only climb in good nick, everything else was running water . 

Lesson #2: **Welsh Winter never lasts:** as Rob, Harriet and Ben found out whilst climbing central gully, with ever worsening conditions and descending darkness. They had rain and snow blowing up the gully and a stream of water running down. These three are serious contenders for this year’s Epic award, returning a mere 14 hours after setting off, abseiling back down in the dark some 300m, all on 2 sandwiches and 2 hours sleep. For the second time, Rob learnt that you should always take your sandwiches.

Lesson #3: **never listen to your passengers.** Ever!

All in all,  it  was as super weekend. For those who hadn’t had enough on Saturday went for a run on Sunday. The rest  either took a leisurely walk or relaxed by the fire drinking tea and reminiscing on good times.
