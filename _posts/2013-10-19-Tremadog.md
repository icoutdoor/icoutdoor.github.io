The annual pilgrimage to Tremadog, North Wales, along with 2 other university clubs, 1 party of novices and one SPA exam. The crag was swamped! Needless to say, if you can get up early enough you will be climbing. Just check what time the sun rises first, note that in September itâ€™s about 7.30am. Claudia and Chris lead some spectacular multipitches just up behind the hut (love the 10 meter walk-ins). Ryan and Andi and company lead some beastly scrambles up Tryfan. Meanwhile, the cragging party left the swamped crag early to go to the beach. With a balmy breeze behind us, 9 imperial cretins all ran straight into the 14 degree C azure water. Almost tropical. Sunday was filled with more climbing and walking.
