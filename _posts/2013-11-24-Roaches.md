A very special trip, staying in the remarkable Don Whillans hut. The boulderers, Chris, Harry and Andi, were so excited to be there that they bouldered from dawn till dusk, and then some more. Harriet, Andrew and Gemma went trad climbing, taking with them some newbies to sample to delights of climbing grit stone in winter. Itâ€™s grippy, but it is cold. Angela, Julia and Jana went hiking, training for their trip to Kilimanjaro next year. There might not be great heights in the Peaks but they certainly covered some distance. Saturday night, we cooked chilli as standard, only this time in a cave. The usual merriment ensued, although apparently no one likes cider. Too bad there were, 18 cans of it. Sunday was another stunning day, we were so fortunate to be bestowed with wonderful weather, though a bit frosty. Over the whole weekend there was only 1 hour of rain, which is quite frankly incredible.
