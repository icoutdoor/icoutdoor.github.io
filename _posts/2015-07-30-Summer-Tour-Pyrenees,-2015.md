Members of the Imperial Outdoor club embarked on an expedition trekking along the French Pyrenees. They followed the GR10 trail, picking it up near Lourdes and trekking to the end in Banyuls sur mer (with a train at some point in the middle due to unexpected ailments). The total length of the trek was 30 days and most nights were spent camping in the middle of nowhere or using cabins in various different conditions (mostly rundown). The team lived mostly off saucisson and couscous and despite all team members losing a substantial amount of weight, none of them starved to death. Many mountains were hiked up and down in baking heat but all members of the team enjoyed themselves to the maximum. The views for the whole trip were astounding and uncomparable to anything in the UK and the experience was just one of many that can be had with the Outdoor Club. For further information just ask one of the committee members or check out the report on the Imperial Exploration Board website (we couldnâ€™t have done it without the support of the board so they deserve a mention).  The basic point is if you want to enjoy life, you should join the Outdoor Club!!
