The club really ought to go to the Peak District more often, there is some great climbing and itâ€™s relatively close to London. This time the club visited the Roaches, where Chris Reminiscing about the past decided to re-do his first ever trad climb. The first time was years ago with his Dad, you never would have thought it as Chris is an excellent climber now but back then, overcome by emotion, he had cried from half way up the route to the belay. This time the route was ascended with not a tear in sight.

Sunday there was some sport climbing, a little mountain biking and a hike. Good weekend!
