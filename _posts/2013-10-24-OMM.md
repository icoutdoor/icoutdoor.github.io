Here we ago again! 4 teams enter the OMM, competing in the Brecon beakons. Not content with the usual rain and accompanying misery, our storm chasers located the biggest storm of the year. Camping was fun. Despite running over 30km the first day, wading across waste-deep mire only to sleep in a water bed (highly recommended), spirits were high. When the going gets tough, just keep smiling. All teams completed and returned safely home to London. Big kudos to Andi, who on the very last  minute filled in as Mikeyâ€™s team mate, 1 hour before the bus left London.
