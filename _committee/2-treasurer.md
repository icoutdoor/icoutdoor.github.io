blurb: "Hi! I'm Ashley. I'm a second-year Aero student and am super excited to be treasurer this year. I'm an adventure enthusiast - when I'm not crunching numbers, I'm trying something new, from scuba diving to flying! I've really enjoyed all of the activities run by the club in my first year and can't wait to meet new people and go on more exciting trips :)"
