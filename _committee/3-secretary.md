blurb: "Hello I'm Evan, a 3rd year biochem student. I love hiking, climbing and kayaking; I like the outdoors and sports in general. I've been climbing for a year now but don't ask me to lead climb because I'm terrified of heights. I devour cheese in great quantities. Never say 'olive oil' or 'wallet' around me; these words are banned."
