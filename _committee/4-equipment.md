blurb: "Hi, I’m James. I’m a third-year Design Engineer, and this year’s equipment officer for the club! As well as coming to as many sessions and trips as I can, that means I look after all the equipment we have in stores - so if you need to borrow anything we might have (ice axes to spoons), or anything we don’t have (I can buy it!) let me know :)"
