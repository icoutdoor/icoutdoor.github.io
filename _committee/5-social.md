blurb: "Hey everyone! I'm a second year Design Engineering student with a knack for climbing trees and having dumb and dangerous ideas. Ironically, my job is to make sure everyone in the club is safe and having fun, so let's see how that goes ðŸ˜‚. On a serious note though, looking forward to meeting everyone and having a blast this year!"
