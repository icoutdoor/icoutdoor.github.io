blurb: "Hi everyone! I'm Ashley and am excited to be social sec this year. When I’m not busy figuring out rocket science, you'll probably find me hiking or climbing somewhere. I'm a huge fan of the outdoor club sandwiches – onions are a must! I really enjoyed the club’s events last year and can't wait to organise more, like games nights and port and cheese evenings. If you have ideas for socials, I'd love to hear them!"
