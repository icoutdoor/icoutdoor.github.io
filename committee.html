                    <p>Hey guys, Iâ€™m Baptiste, also known as Le PrÃ©sident (yes Iâ€™m French, love cheese and am president of the club). Iâ€™ll be around a lot with you guys when climbing in London and on trips too. Iâ€™m also interested in biking, sailing and swimming. Iâ€™m very approachable and try my best to be funny so feel free to come talk to me at any time!</p>

                    <p>Hello I'm Evan, a 3rd year biochem student. I love hiking, climbing and kayaking; I like the outdoors and sports in general. I've been climbing for a year now but don't ask me to lead climb because I'm terrified of heights. I devour cheese in great quantities. Never say 'olive oil' or 'wallet' around me; these words are banned.</p>

                    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m James. Iâ€™m a third-year Design Engineer, and this yearâ€™s equipment officer for the club! As well as coming to as many sessions and trips as I can, that means I look after all the equipment we have in stores - so if you need to borrow anything we might have (ice axes to spoons), or anything we donâ€™t have (I can buy it!) let me know :)</p>

                    <p>Hey everyone! I'm a second year Design Engineering student with a knack for climbing trees and having dumb and dangerous ideas. Ironically, my job is to make sure everyone in the club is safe and having fun, so let's see how that goes ðŸ˜‚. On a serious note though, looking forward to meeting everyone and having a blast this year!</p>
